# custom-mdk template guide

A Minecraft mod template for multi-version and multi-loader development, powered by a single Gradle multi-project build. It includes Kotlin DSL build logic, shared source sets, Mixin support, Parchment mappings where available, generated mod metadata, versioned artifact names, Java toolchain management, runtime mod staging, and GitHub Actions for build workflows.

Only the subprojects included in `settings.gradle.kts` are configured. Remove unused `include(...)` lines when you do not need a version or loader.

## Project Layout

- `common`: shared Java code used by every supported target.
- `<minecraft>-common`: version-specific shared code. Older versions use the Legacy Forge toolchain; 1.21+ and 26.x use NeoForm through NeoForge ModDev.
- `<minecraft>-fabric`: Fabric loader project.
- `<minecraft>-forge`: Legacy Forge loader project.
- `<minecraft>-neo`: NeoForge loader project.
- `src/config`: config-related common code that is packaged into the jar but kept out of the default main source set.
- `src/configClient`: client-only config screen helpers for loaders that expose a config UI.
- `buildSrc`: convention plugins that define loader-specific Gradle behavior.
- `gradle.properties`: mod metadata shared by generated `mods.toml`, `neoforge.mods.toml`, and `fabric.mod.json` files.
- `version.txt`: the mod version used for project versions, artifact names, and generated metadata.

## Setup

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub to create your repository from this template.
2. If you want to keep receiving template updates, initialize upstream tracking
   before regular development. See [Receiving Upstream Updates](#receiving-upstream-updates).
3. Edit `settings.gradle.kts` and remove unused subprojects to reduce Gradle configuration time and cache usage.
4. Edit `gradle.properties` for your mod id, name, group, license, authors, URLs, and Fabric entry points, and edit `version.txt` for your mod version.
5. Rename ALL Java package names (including those in the shared configuration system) to avoid conflicts with other mods. Update `Constants`, entry points, mixin config names, and language assets from `examplemod` to your mod id.
6. Create a root `README.md` and `LICENSE` for your mod. Keep `docs/*.md` unchanged if you want future template updates to merge cleanly.

## Generated Metadata

Fabric `fabric.mod.json` files are generated from shared values in `gradle.properties`, `version.txt`, and the Fabric convention plugin. The convention provides common fields such as the mod id, version, authors, contact URLs, environment, entry points, Java requirement, Minecraft requirement, Fabric API dependency, and optional Forge Config API Port dependency.

Each `<minecraft>-fabric/src/main/templates/fabric.mod.json` file is a small override JSON. Values written there are merged over the generated defaults, so use it for target-specific metadata or extra dependencies without duplicating the common metadata. Nested objects such as `depends` are merged recursively.

## Requirements

- JDK 25 is recommended for configuring Gradle and matches the GitHub Actions build environment.
- Gradle downloads the toolchain needed by each Minecraft version through Foojay Toolchain Resolver.
- Version targets currently compile with:
  - Java 17: `common`, `1.18.2`, `1.19.2`, `1.20.1`
  - Java 21: `1.21.1`, `1.21.8`, `1.21.11`
  - Java 25: `26.1`, `26.1.2`

## Building

Build every included subproject on macOS or Linux:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

On Windows:

```sh
./gradlew.bat build
```

Build a specific platform:

```sh
./gradlew :26.1.2-fabric:build
./gradlew :26.1.2-forge:build
```

Artifacts are written to `<subproject>/build/libs/`. Additional runtime-only mod jars declared through `runtimeMods` are collected in `<subproject>/build/runtimeMods/` for CI.

## Running

Run a client:

```sh
./gradlew :26.1.2-fabric:runClient
./gradlew :26.1.2-neo:runClient
```

Run a server:

```sh
./gradlew :26.1.2-fabric:runServer
./gradlew :26.1.2-neo:runServer
```

## Configuration System

Shared config entries live in `common/src/config/java/.../config`. Define entries with `ConfigEntryBuilder`, collect them as `ConfigEntries`, and expose each file through a `ConfigDeclaration` in `ModConfigs`.

Config support is split into dedicated source sets so projects that do not opt into the config conventions can avoid resolving the extra config dependencies. Shared config declarations belong in `common/src/config`, version-specific config code belongs in `<minecraft>-common/src/config`, loader bindings belong in `<minecraft>-<loader>/src/config`, and client-only config screen helpers belong in `<minecraft>-<loader>/src/configClient`.

Apply the matching config convention plugin in addition to the normal loader convention when a project needs config support:

| Project type | Config convention |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `common` | `common-config-conventions` |
| Legacy Forge version common | `legacyforge-common-config-conventions` |
| NeoForge version common | `neoforge-common-config-conventions` |
| Legacy Forge loader project | `legacyforge-config-conventions` |
| Fabric loader project | `fabric-config-conventions` |
| NeoForge loader project | `neoforge-config-conventions` |

These conventions wire the `config` and `configClient` outputs into the jar and into the appropriate compile/runtime classpaths. Fabric config projects also add Forge Config API Port to `implementation`/`modImplementation`, `runtimeMods`, and generated `fabric.mod.json` dependencies.

```java
public final class ServerConfig {
    private static final ConfigEntryBuilder BUILDER = new ConfigEntryBuilder();

    public static final ConfigEntry.BooleanEntry ENABLE_FEATURE =
            BUILDER.comment("Enable a server feature")
                    .define("enableFeature", true);

    public static final ConfigEntries ENTRIES = BUILDER.build();

    private ServerConfig() {}
}
```

```java
public final class ModConfigs {
    public static final ConfigDeclaration SERVER =
            ConfigDeclaration.of(ConfigSide.SERVER, ServerConfig.ENTRIES);
    public static final ConfigDeclaration CLIENT =
            ConfigDeclaration.of(ConfigSide.CLIENT, ClientConfig.ENTRIES, "examplemod-client-special.toml");

    public static final List<ConfigDeclaration> ALL = List.of(SERVER, CLIENT);

    private ModConfigs() {}
}
```

`ConfigSide.SERVER`, `ConfigSide.CLIENT`, and `ConfigSide.COMMON` are mapped to the loader-specific config type by each platform. The optional file name is passed through to the loader API; omit it to use the loader default.

The common config declarations are loader-neutral. Each platform provides the dependency and registrar needed for its target, plus optional client-side helpers when it exposes a config screen:

| Target                 | Required config dependency                            | Registration                                     | Optional config screen dependency                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NeoForge platforms     | NeoForge config API from the loader                   | `ModContainer#registerConfig`                    | none; the config screen is provided by NeoForge directly                                                                                                 |
| Legacy Forge platforms | Forge config API from the loader                      | `ModLoadingContext` / `FMLJavaModLoadingContext` | [Configured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured) or [Forge Config Screens](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-screens)           |
| Fabric platforms       | Forge Config API Port, declared per Minecraft version | Forge Config API Port registry                   | [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/) for the mod list entry; [Forge Config Screens](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-screens) on <=mc1.20.1 |

Because of this, the same `ConfigDeclaration` list can be shared from `common`, extended by a version-specific common project, and then bound by each platform to the dependency it actually runs with.

The builder supports primitive values, ranged numbers, strings, lists, enums, and nested sections:

```java
BUILDER.comment("Max stored items")
        .defineInRange("maxStoredItems", 64, 1, 4096);
BUILDER.comment("Allowed item ids")
        .defineList("allowedItems", List.of("minecraft:stone"), () -> "minecraft:stone", value -> value instanceof String);
BUILDER.comment("Advanced settings")
        .category("advanced", AdvancedConfig.ENTRIES);
```

The template registers `ModConfigs.ALL` directly. Use this when every included target can share the same config files:

```java
PlatformConfigRegistrar.registerAll(modContainer, VersionedConfigSpec.bindAll(ModConfigs.ALL));
```

Fabric uses the same flow, but passes the mod id instead of the `ModContainer`:

```java
PlatformConfigRegistrar.registerAll(Constants.MODID, VersionedConfigSpec.bindAll(ModConfigs.ALL));
```

When a version-specific common project such as `26.1.2-common` needs extra entries, append them before a platform binds the declarations:

```java
public final class VersionedModConfigs {
    public static final List<ConfigDeclaration> ALL =
            ConfigDeclarations.append(ModConfigs.ALL, ModConfigs.SERVER, VersionedServerConfig.ENTRIES);

    private VersionedModConfigs() {}
}
```

When a platform such as `26.1.2-fabric` or `26.1.2-neo` needs its own entries, append them in the entry point before calling `PlatformConfigRegistrar`:

```java
var configs = ConfigDeclarations.append(VersionedModConfigs.ALL, ModConfigs.SERVER, NeoServerConfig.ENTRIES);
PlatformConfigRegistrar.registerAll(modContainer, VersionedConfigSpec.bindAll(configs));
```

## GitHub Actions

The build workflow detects subprojects from `settings.gradle.kts`, builds each one independently, uploads loader artifacts, runs the available server or game-test smoke checks, and then launches a headless client runtime test with the produced jars. Note: Fabric Game Tests are configured through Fabric Loom and run as part of the Fabric `build` task.

### Release CI

The Release workflow builds every included platform project, collects the
distribution jars, generates release notes from the commits since the latest
`v*` tag, creates a new tag, and publishes a GitHub Release with the jars
attached.

To publish a release:

1. Open **Actions** > **Release** > **Run workflow** on GitHub.
2. Select the branch to release.
3. Choose a version bump type and run the workflow.

The available bump types are:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | Select `major` for a breaking change (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`), `minor` for `feat`, or `patch` otherwise. Commits with the `mdk` type are ignored. |
| `none` | Publish the version already stored in `version.txt` without changing it. Commit and push the intended version before running the workflow. |
| `patch` | Increment the patch version. |
| `minor` | Increment the minor version. |
| `major` | Increment the major version. |

For any bump type except `none`, the workflow updates `version.txt`, commits the
new version as `release: <version>`, and pushes the commit to the selected
branch before building the release. Release notes include breaking changes,
`feat`, `fix`, and `perf` commits. Template maintenance commits with the `mdk`
type and other commit types are omitted.

## Receiving Upstream Updates

Repositories created with GitHub's **Use this template** button do not share Git
history with this template repository. If you want to keep receiving upstream
template updates, initialize your repository history from `upstream/main` before
you start regular development.

Add this template repository as an upstream remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Meatwo310/custom-mdk.git
git fetch upstream
```

Then replace the freshly created local `main` branch with `upstream/main` and
force-push it to your repository:

```sh
git switch main
git reset --hard upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

This rewrites the initial repository history. Do this only before other people
base work on your repository, and save any local changes first.

<details>
<summary>If downstream development has already started</summary>

If you do not want to rewrite history, merge the template history instead:

```sh
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories upstream/main
```

This keeps your existing commits and creates a merge commit that connects the
two histories. You may need to resolve conflicts when both repositories changed
the same files.

</details>

After this one-time setup, pull template updates when needed:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Resolve conflicts carefully, then commit the merge.
